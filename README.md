# JDA T Shirt Design Project!

Using a program like GIMP, the possiblities are endless!

### Requirements
- Should include at least one image
- Should play around with colors and filters
- Should take advantage of **layers**
- Your amazing design should be masked _within_ the T shirt template outline.


## Layer Masking?
GIMP allows you to use _layers_ and a lot of times you will need to exclude parts of a layer. In our project, we want to exclude the **outside** of the t shirt outline so our design stays _inside_ visible only on the inside of the t shirt.

Or ask Mr. Tyhacz!
